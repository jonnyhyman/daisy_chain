# üåº DaisyChain
__Script and workflow manager for DaVinci Resolve__


## Goals
- _Make DaVinci Resolve/Fusion scripting fast, fun, and reliable_
- _Write scripts with full autocompletion, and in-IDE documentation_
- _Turn your one-off script automations into ongoing organized workflows_
- _Experiment with Resolve scripts safely, on an unbounded undo tree_
- _Share your workflows and use those that others have shared_

## Status
Experimental ‚ö†Ô∏è (Use caution, most script executions are irreversible!)

|Language|Resolve API|Fusion API|Tests|
|--|--|--|--|
|Python| ‚úÖ | üöß | ‚ùå |
|Lua | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
|JS/TS| ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
|Rust| ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |

## Why?
Blackmagic's API for Resolve and Fusion is extensive and powerful,
but woefully undocumented and behind-the-times architecturally.
From locking users into antiquated Python versions, to non-existent
(or silent) errors/exceptions/tracebacks, to documentation in a .txt
file without any IDE / language-server support, scripting is _not fun_.

DaisyChain makes it so you can use the Resolve/Fusion API
from any language you like (Python __3.6-3.12+__, Lua, JS, TS, Rust),
in any execution environment you like (terminal, localhost web app, ...)
while retaining full in-editor documentation stubs and types.

It does this by hosting a remote procedure call server within Resolve,
and defining a serialized interface for the entire API surface.
(The Resolve API itself is actually an RPC server, so this is really
like an RPC of an RPC. While a little bit ridiculous, this allows us
to write and use the API in a familiar way with full documentation)

Types, documentation, and RPC connection is written in each client language,
see the status of your favorite language in the Status table above.

## Script use-cases

- üöß A Chromium / WebKit extension to "Download to Media Pool" from internet, called CreditsDue
- üöß A script to copy from a current-timeline-item metadata field to clipboard on a timer, called CopyCat
- üöß A more accurate transcription workflow than Resolve's trashy one, using OpenAI Whisper
- üöß Removing silence from a clip automatically (via ffmpeg or some loopback)
- üöß `py-auto-gui` madness to automate repetitive edit tasks (macros, basically)

## Audience
- Jonny mostly, for now
- Later, lazy video editors with coding experience
- Later, production houses with workflow programmers on staff

## Installation

1. Set Resolve External Scripting to Local or Network
2. Install Python
2. Ensure that the PYTHONHOME env variable is set at system level,
    to point to the directory where you will find the python3.exe,
    or symlink that path with /usr/local/bin/python3
2. Copy the DaisyChain Host script into Resolve's watch folder for scripts
    macOS

    ```
    cp "./python/DaisyChain Host.py" "/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Scripts/Utility"
    ```
    
    Windows
    üìÅ "%AppData%\\Blackmagic Design\\DaVinci Resolve\\Support\\Fusion\\Scripts\\Utility"

    Linux
    üìÅ "~/.local/share/DaVinciResolve/Fusion/Scripts/Utility"

3. Open 

4. Close and open Resolve if it was open


## Roadmap

__Milestone 1__ Python server and client
- [x] Python RPC Server
- [x] Python RPC client with Resolve API coverage, types, and docstrings
- [ ] Python RPC client with Fusion API coverage, types, and docstrings

__Milestone 2__ multi-language
- [ ] JS RPC client with API coverage, types, and documentation
- [ ] Lua RPC client with API coverage

__Milestone 3__ reversibility & safety
- [ ] RPC Server should
    - [ ] Validate all input types before executing any function in the API
    - [ ] Retain an infinite undo-tree (with timestamps) for reverting to previous states

__Milestone 3__ user interface & sharing 
- [ ] Build a workflow scheduler & package/script manager UI and package manager
- [ ] Determine if you even need a workflow scheduler UI or if Warp/tmux/nu is just fine?

## Contribution

Feel free to report bugs / issues, but do not expect any serious support on the Issues page.

If you would like to contribute a client package for your favorite language, or a suite of tests for existing code, please feel free to submit a pull request!


## Technical notes

Since it seems like the Resolve API is designed for syncronous execution, let's stick to
having syncronous execution of the RPC server, so that we can't overload the integration API. 
With that said, it would be worth doing some testing to see what happens with multiple servers
running at the same time, and what the maximum refresh rate / transaction rate of the API is.
